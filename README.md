## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Making sure my HTML and CSS skills are top notch, I went ahead and recreated the Slate News website using only a photo as a reference. Then going above and beyond to make sure the websites are Mobile-Friendly. Being able to recreate countless websites from scratch using only a photo has allowed me to keep my skills to the best of their abilities

## Optimizations

Making the whole website mobile friendly and responsive

## Lessons Learned:

Splitting the header fom the rest of HTML Document has allowed me to move it around the DOM when going into the mobile-friendly version of the website
